# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
I created this repository to keep a track of all the files and source code that I used to complete the course. You can get more details on the course by visiting the [Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). Hope this is helpful to other students and would let them clear some of their doubts.
I would be glad if you could leave a star!!

# Disclaimer
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/) policy of the course.

# Personal note
Don't stress out if you find the problems in this course to be difficult. All of us felt that because that is the whole point. Be comfortable being uncomfortable sometimes and enjoy the journey.
